Grab some coffee and a donut, and stay awhile.

#### A haphazard blog with a rowing habit

We plan to chat about lots of trivia and handy ideas about rowing, boats,
swimming holes, random other adventures, and good bakeries.

Sketches, poems, cartoons, and guest writers. You might even find some nuggets
of wisdom about rigging, trailering, drillwork, teamwork, and racing.

#### Tech tips on setting up your blog

We decided to host this blog on GitHub Pages because we read a bunch of articles
about different options, and this seemed simple, lightweight and cool.

So we'll share stuff we learn as we go along about authoring in
[markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), using [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and
experimenting with themes, Liquid, and CSS.

The first of these will be:

- How to set up two different GitHub accounts, work and personal, and overcome the obstacles you might encounter without having your entire life fall apart at 2am. It is possbile.

Here are some good articles to get started with:

- [Build a Blog With Jekyll and GitHub Pages(https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)] by [Barry Clark](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/barryclark/)

- [Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages)


#### Story Contributions

Have a rowing story? Once we get officially launched, we will welcome your
contributions.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/
and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the
[Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub. -->
