title: Welcome to our rowing jam!
---

Grab some coffee and a donut, and stay awhile. We plan to chat about lots of
trivia and handy ideas about rowing, boats, swimming holes, random other
adventures, and good bakeries.

There will be sketches, poems, cartoons, and guest writers. You might even find
some nuggets of wisdom about rigging, trailering, drillwork, teamwork, and
racing.

Have a rowing story? Once we get officially launched, we will welcome your
contributions.
